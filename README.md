This repository contains:
* Exploratory data analysis report containing an extensive examination of the dataset through visualizations prior to implementing classification models.
* Final report containing implementation of classification models, technical analysis, and commentary over full research process.

This project evaluates different models to predict the number of paid monthly gigs Austin musicians receive.
Using a 5-fold cross-validation, we evalaute the performance of 2 KNN models:

* Based on spending on publicity, merchandise, and gear
   
* Based on musicians' distance to downtwon Austin and booking service used
